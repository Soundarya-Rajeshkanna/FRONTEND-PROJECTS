            <p>Microforms are scaled-down reproductions of documents, typically either films or paper, made for the purposes of transmission, storage, reading, and printing. Microform images are commonly reduced to about 4% or one twenty-fifth of the original document size. For special purposes, greater optical reductions may be used.</p>

            <p>In microphotography, the photographer uses a special negative known as a microfilm to preserve the images. Here, the subject to be photographed (documents etc) may be photographed in one of two ways; a linear array or a two dimensional array.</p>
